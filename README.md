House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project demonstrates a basic regression task using machine learning techniques in Python.

Project Overview
In this project, we predict the prices of houses based on their characteristics using a dataset provided by Kaggle's House Prices competition. The primary goal is to implement a simple regression model and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

Key Features:
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square footage.
BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground.
FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
The target variable is the SalePrice of houses.

Workflow
The project is divided into several stages:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset using pandas.
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values.
Selecting relevant features.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library.
Model Evaluation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²) score

Installation
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install them individually using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd house-price-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can open the notebook and run the cells step by step:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/house_price_prediction.ipynb
Alternatively, you can run the code in any Python IDE or directly from the command line by modifying the scripts.

Model Performance
After training the model, the performance was evaluated using the test set with the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, useful for interpreting errors in the same units as the target variable.
R-squared (R²): The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
