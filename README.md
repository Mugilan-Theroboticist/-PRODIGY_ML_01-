# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## This repository contains the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The project demonstrates a basic regression task using machine learning techniques in Python.
# Project Overview
## In this project, we predict the prices of houses based on their characteristics using a dataset provided by Kaggle's House Prices competition. The primary goal is to implement a simple regression model and evaluate its performance using various metrics.

# Key Features:
'''
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square footage.
BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground.
FullBath: Number of full bathrooms.
'''

# Data Preprocessing:
'''
Handling missing values.
Selecting relevant features.
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
'''
# Model Training:
Training a Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library.
# Model Evaluation:
'''
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²) score
'''
# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
'''
